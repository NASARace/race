this directory contains trust/keystores plus self signed CA certificates

                       FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY !!

The certificates/stores were generated with the script/gen-ca-cert.sh and
script/gen-server-cert.sh scripts.

The 'localhost.jks' passphrase is 'wz3YEbokEb'

This directory also contains an example of a encrypted user password file 
'users' that contains a single 'gonzo' user entry with a 'whatever' password,
which was created with the script/passwd tool.
