# TODO List

### sync instantiation/startup
make sure we don't start if there is any timeout or exception in a non-optional actor

### FlightEntry marker symbol
use normal PointPlacemark, no need for screen-to-world mapping

### use DynamicPath for flight path display
adapt based on eye-altitude

### generic bucket-counter 
as basis for stats distribution/variance computation

### web based StatsReporter
