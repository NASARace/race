About RACE
==========

As the name *Runtime for Airspace Concept Evaluation* implies, RACE was originally created as a
framework to simplify building airspace simulations, but its design makes it suitable for any 
**event based**, **reactive** system that needs to be
 
- extensible - easily allows adding new components
- scalable - supports concurrent and distributed components
- heterogenous - can interface to external systems
- portable - runs on any Java supported platform

RACE itself is also meant to be **accessible**, it is open sourced under Apache v2 license, only 
depends on open sourced 3rd party components, and leverages existing technologies, formats and tools
wherever possible.

RACE is **not** a monolythic system or standalone tool. Its main executable expects a configuration
file (readable text, normally using HOCON_ syntax) that specifies which components a particular
RACE system consists of, and how these components interact.

Although RACE systems can be composed of components that do not interact with the outside world,
they typically incorporate external systems such as

- live data feeds (servers, sensors, aircraft etc.)
- hardware simulators
- foreign data distribution services (bus systems)

However, each of these external systems has to be interfaced through a dedicated RACE component.

RACE supports seamless networking between different RACE instances. This allows for systems
in which certain components have to be synchronized (e.g. displays), and for system topologies in
which external systems can only be accessed at a certain physical location. RACE instances can also
be started and controlled remotely.

The underlying *application model* is a reactive, distributed, event based system. The computational
model employed by RACE to process such events is the well known Actor_ programming model, which
uses dedicated objects (aka *actors*) that only communicate through asynchronous messages and don't
share internal state. This has a profound impact on how RACE can make use of massive concurrency
without burdening the developer with explicit synchronization, which is otherwise notoriously hard
to design and test. Please refer to the `Actors`_ section for more details.

RACE uses the Akka_ library as a basis for its actor infrastructure, and hence promotes the
use of Scala_ as the programming language to develop such actors (although Java can be used
too - please see the `Why Scala`_ section for details).

The main aspects that RACE adds on top of plain Akka_ are

- runtime configuration of actors
- deterministic construction, initialization, start and termination of actor systems
- seamless location transparency (actors can run locally or remote without requiring code changes)
- time management (simulation clock)
- coexisting, seamless local and distributed publish/subscribe communication between actors

To achieve this, RACE employs its own RaceActors_ classes, which are the building blocks of
its applications. While the standard RACE distribution comes with a number of ready-to-use
``RaceActors`` for tasks such as importing external data, this is the major extension axis of RACE.
Most real world RACE applications will add specific actors, and hence RACE was designed to minimize
the overhead that is required for developing new ``RaceActors``.
