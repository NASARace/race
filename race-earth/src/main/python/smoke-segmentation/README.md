To get the smoke segmentation operational, first ensure you have anaconda installed. 

Then, create an anaconda environment with the command: "conda env create -f environment.yml"

Test the environment set up with: "conda activate odin"

Deactivate the environment with: "conda deactivate"

In the smoke segmentation config files, replace the 'python-exe' path to the path of your odin python executable.
