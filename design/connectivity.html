        <div class="main">
            <h1 id="connecting-external-systems" class="title">Connecting External Systems</h1>
            <p>Most RACE applications depend on external input from systems such as FAA&#39;s <a href="https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/programs/swim/">SWIM</a> servers,
            and/or produce data to be used in external systems such as flight simulators.</p>
            <p>Since virtually everything in RACE is done by means of actors it comes at no surprise that such
            communication takes place from dedicated <strong>Import/ExportActors</strong>, which constitute the outside
            interface of RACE.</p>
            <p><img class="center scale60" src="../images/import-export.svg" alt="Import/Export Actors"></p>
            <p>RACE employs a two layer approach for such interfacing. In most cases the import/export actors only
            handle the underlying high level communication mechanism (e.g. messaging systems such as JMS or
            Kafka), and leave payload data processing such as filtering or translation to embedded <em>reader</em> and
            <em>writer</em> objects that can be configured within the respective import/export actor.</p>
            <p>Import and export actors are conceptually very close to Archive/ReplayActors (see <a href="archive-replay.html#archive-and-replay">Archive and Replay</a>).
            In fact, they should be exchangeable so that the only difference between live and
            archive/replay processing is the specification of respective actors.</p>
            
            <h2 id="import-export-actors" class="section">Import/Export Actors</h2>
            <p>The main concern of the actors is to establish a connection or session with the external system,
            and to exchange data with it by means of a connection specific API (e.g. JMS) which typically does
            not care about the nature and format of the exchanged (payload) data. Consequently, the essential
            configuration of import/export actors is a specification of the external application to communicate
            with, which might involve hostname/ip-address, port, topics and user credentials (see
            <a href="../usage/encryption.html#using-encrypted-configurations">Using Encrypted Configurations</a> if this is sensitive data):</p>
            <pre><code>actors = [ ...
  { name = &quot;ZZimporter&quot;
    class = &quot;x.y.ZZImportActor&quot;
    write-to = &quot;/zz/in&quot;

    remote-host = ...
    remote-user = &quot;??ZZuser&quot;

    reader = { ... }
  }
  ...</code></pre>
            <p>Receiving data from the external system normally involves blocking IO and is therefore done by a
            dedicated data acquisition thread that is spawned by the actor upon initialization or start. This
            thread is only visible to the actor instance, but care has to be taken to avoid data races between
            the data acquisition thread and the rest of the actor code, which is executed within a Akka thread
            (the <code>handleMessage()</code> method being its main entry). Publishing received data to RACE channels can
            be done directly from the input acquisition thread since Akka&#39;s messaging API is thread safe.</p>
            <p>Import actors typically mix in <code>gov.nasa.race.core.PublishingRaceActor</code>. Received data is
            filtered/translated by the configured <em>reader</em> object and then published to the respective
            <code>write-to</code> RACE channels. Since some external systems provide high volume data streams which might
            imply high runtime costs within RACE (e.g. for translation), some import actors use the RACE
            <a href="channeltopics.html#channeltopics">ChannelTopics</a> mechanism to make sure received data is only published on RACE channels if there is a
            client requesting it. This can also make use of the <code>gov.nasa.race.actor.FilteringPublisher</code>
            trait.</p>
            <p>Export actors mix in <code>gov.nasa.race.core.SubscribingRaceActor</code>, pass received RACE messages
            through their writer* objects and then use the connection API to send the data, which is normally
            non-blocking and therefore can happen from a Akka thread.</p>
            <p>Import and export are roles which can be fulfilled by the same actor instance. This is particularly
            the case for actors that interface to external simulators, which usually involves bi-directional
            data exchange that needs to be synchronized.</p>
            <p>Most import/export actor (basic) types can be found in the <code>race-net-*</code> modules (jms, kafka,
            http, dds at this point). Most of the concrete import and export actors reside in the
            <code>gov.nasa.race.air.actor</code> package.</p>
            
            <h2 id="readers-writers" class="section">Readers / Writers</h2>
            <p>Those are the objects that understand both RACE objects (such as <code>gov.nasa.race.track.TrackedObject</code>)
            and external system data formats (protocol specific <em>records</em> and serialization formats).
            Readers/Writers do not need to know about networking or other IPC mechanisms used to transmit
            the data they process, nor should they (normally) know about the actor that creates/uses them.</p>
            <p>Not all import/export actors need translation of payload data - some of the mechanism specific APIs
            (e.g. JMS and Kafka) do the wire format translation for us, and the incoming data might be just
            structured text such as XML messages. For this reason there is no uniform interface or type for
            readers and writers, just a number of very generic functional interfaces such as</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>gov.nasa.race.DataStreamReader</code> and <code>DataStreamWriter</code></li>
              <li><code>gov.nasa.race.Filter</code></li>
              <li><code>gov.nasa.race.Translator</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Readers and writers are nested objects. If the respective import/export actor is not single-purpose
            (such as connecting to one specific simulator), they are specified within the actor configuration:</p>
            <pre><code>actors = [ ...
  { name = &quot;SomeImportActor&quot;
    ...
    reader = {
      class = &quot;x.y.MyReader&quot;
      ...
    }</code></pre>
            <p>Normally readers and writers do not need to be named and the only mandatory configuration is their
            respective <code>class</code>. However, they can be fully parameterized as the actor passes the whole
            sub-configuration object down into the reader/writer constructor, i.e. the reader/writer class is
            the only type that has to know about such parameters.</p>
            
            <h2 id="adapteractor-and-the-race-adapter-module" class="section">AdapterActor and the race-adapter module</h2>
            <p>Most external systems that are used with RACE provide a networking interface, and make use of
            common APIs such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bncdq.html">JMS</a> to establish sessions and exchange data. In this case, all that is needed
            to connect RACE is a suitable set of import/export actors for the respective API (such as JMS, Kafka,
            DDS and Http).</p>
            <p>For cases in which there is no external network interface RACE provides the generic <code>AdapterActor</code>,
            together with corresponding native libraries that can be used to implement a network interface
            within the external system. The C based incarnation of this library is <code>librace.a</code>.</p>
            <p><img class="center scale60" src="../images/race-adapter.svg" alt="AdapterActor and librace.a"></p>
            <p><code>AdapterActor</code> uses UDP sockets to communicate with the external system.</p>
            <p>The underlying wire format is compaatible with <code>java.io.DataInput/OutputStream</code>, i.e. does not
            require any translation on the JVM side, but only supports basic Java types (boolean, short,
            int, long, float, double and String - no references).</p>
            <p>The protocol distinguishes between a <em>server</em> (which has to be started first) and a <em>client</em> (which
            requests a connection), but supports bi-directional data transfer.</p>
            <p>The client initiates the session by sending a <code>Request</code> message, together with parameters such as
            the requested schema name and update interval.</p>
            <p>If the server can send/receive the requested data at the requested rate it send back a <code>Accept</code>
            message with a client id, which the client henceforth uses to identify itself. Otherwise, a
            <code>Reject</code> with a explaining error code is sent.</p>
            <p>The server now enters a loop in which it periodically send <code>Data</code> messages at the requested rate,
            and either synchronously or asynchronously reads (optional) <code>Data</code> messages from the client.</p>
            <p>Data messages have a generic payload - neither <code>AdapterActor</code> nor <code>librace</code> care about what data
            is sent, except of that both client and server have to agree on the schema (name) that defines the
            exchanged payload data. RACE comes with a <code>gov.nasa.race.air.SimpleTrackProtocol</code> that implements
            <code>Track</code> and <code>Proximity</code> data messages.</p>
            <p>A session can be terminated at any time by sending a <code>Stop</code> message from either client or server.</p>
            <p>On the RACE side the application specific payload data is handled by configured reader and writer
            objects of the <code>AdapterActor</code>.</p>
            <p>On the external side, <code>librace</code> requires the user to specify respective callback functions (such
            as <code>check_request()</code> or <code>write_data()</code>) within a <code>local_context_t</code> structure, and then call
            one of the toplevel functions such as <code>race_interval_threaded(local_context_t* context)</code>.</p>
            <p><code>librace</code> also provides a number of convenience functions (e.g. to read/write data in <code>DataOutputStream</code>
            format) that can be used to implement the required callbacks. Please refer to <code>race.h</code> for details,
            which is the only required header.</p>
